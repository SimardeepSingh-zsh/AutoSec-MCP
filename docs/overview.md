This hub connects three pillars:
- Snyk detects vulnerabilities and emits structured results.
- n8n orchestrates decision logic, notifications, and API calls.
- MCP servers expose controlled, scriptable capabilities (e.g., open issues, create branches, invoke internal tools).

Flow:
1. A Snyk scan runs (CLI or CI) and posts results to an n8n webhook.
2. n8n parses and filters by severity, routes to Slack/Email/Jira/GitHub.
3. For specific cases, n8n calls an MCP server to perform guided actions (e.g., open a PR with a dependency bump).
4. Everything is logged and auditable.

Design principles:
- Safety first: dry-run modes, approvals, and rollbacks.
- Composable: each step can be replaced with your own tools.
- Minimal secrets: prefer short-lived tokens and least-privilege scopes.
